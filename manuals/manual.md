## Setup

1. **Define yourself:** Each Commander takes a _Commander Card_ and places it in front of them.
2. **Shuffle Play Cards:** Shuffle all Journey Cards in a single deck, place it near the Hyperspace Area, face down, this is the Play Deck.
3. **Deal the Quest Piles:** From the Play Deck, deal face down Journey Cards to each Commander depending on the amount of Commanders:

   - 2 Commanders: 35 cards

   Each Commander, place its Quest Pile in front of them next to their Star Map area.
   Flip the top card face up. That is each Commanders's first Quest.

4. **Deal the Commander Hand:** From the Play deck, deal face down cards to each Commander depending on the amount of Commanders:

   - 2-6 Commanders: 7 cards
   - 7-8 Commanders: 6 cards

   Each Commander takes these cards in their hand and keeps them private.

5. **You are ready to start!** The Commander who wants to start first, starts. **Fortune favours the bold!**

## Game Structure

- Each Commander plays its turn one-by-one playing clockwise until the game ends. During its turn, this Commander is considered the Active Commander.
- Commanders will build Journey Piles in the Hyperspace Area.
- Journey Piles are always started with a Wormhole (0) and will grow in ascending order using Planets (1-10) until the Final Frontier (11).
- Any Commander can add cards to any Journey Pile.
- There can be any amount of Journey piles in play at the same time.
- Only a card that is the next number in the sequence can be played in a Journey Pile. (The sequence is: Wormhole (0) -> Planets (1-10) -> Final Frontier (11))
- Commanders can only place cards and use its abilities in their turn, when they are the Active Commander.
- The Active Commander can place as many cards as it wants in the Hyperspace Area.
- Played cards can be from its hand, Star Map lanes or Quest pile.
- **End of turn:** When the Active Commander cannot or doesn't wish to play more cards, it must end its turn by placing a card from its hand in the one of the Star Map lanes.
  Once the Active Commander places a card in the Star Map the turn ends and the next Commander in the round starts its turn.
- Commander Abilities always override the original rules.

## Turn Sequence

1. **Place cards in the HYperspace Area:**
   - The Active Commander can place cards from 3 different sources:
     - **Its hand**: If the Active Commander doesn't have cards in its hand, it must Refill from the Card deck back to the defined Commander Hand size (7 cards for 2-6 Commanders, 6 cards for 7-8 Commanders).
     - **Its Quest pile**: Only the top card of the pile can be played. Once the top card is played, flip the next card face up. The Active Commander can place more than one Quest card in the same turn as long as are part of a valid ladder sequence.
     - **Its Star Map lanes:** Only the top card of each stack can be played. If a card is under another card in a lane, the card that is covering must be removed first in order to free the card underneath. Star Map cards cannot be moved between lanes. They can only be played in the Play Area.
   - The Active Commander can place as many cards as it wants in the Hyperspace Area, as long as they are part of a valid for the ladder sequence. (Wormhole (0) -> Planets (1-10) -> Final Frontier (11))
   - The Active Commander is not forced to play cards in the Hyperspace Area, it can decide to stop stage at any time during its turn.
   - If the Active Commander runs out of cards, it Refills its Hand from the Play Deck up to the defined Commander Hand size (7 cards for 2-6 Commanders, 6 cards for 7-8 Commanders). After refilling it can continue placing cards in the Hyperspace Area as normal.
   - If the Commander doesn't have any valid cards to place in the Play Area, or doesn't want to place anymore, it proceeds to the next step.
2. **Place card in Star Map lane:**
   - The Active Commander MUST place a card from its hand in a Star Map lane.
   - The Active Commander can only place ONE card each turn, unless a Commander Ability overrules this.
   - Each Commander has 4 Star Map lanes.
   - Any card type can be placed in any lane.
   - If a lane already has cards a new card can be added on top of the stack partially covering the previous cards.
   - Once placed, cards cannot be moved or removed from the Star Map. The only way to remove cards from the Star Map is by playing the topmost of each stack in the Play Area during your turn.
3. **Refill Hand:** The Active Commander takes as many cards from the Play Deck as needed to go back to the defined Commander Hand size (7 cards for 2-6 Commanders, 6 cards for 7-8 Commanders).
   For example: Petter has 3 cards left, he needs 4 to reach 7. He takes 4 cards from the Play deck.

## Commander Abilities

Each Commander has two types of abilities:

- Play: Play the ability in an specific Journey Pile. The pile chosen, is the one that will be affected by the ability. If the ability uses another Journey Card, place both cards at the same time. The Commander Card is trapped in that Journey Pile until that pile reaches Final Frontier. When that happens, the Commander Card is freed and goes back to the Commander who owned it.
- Discard: To use this ability, place the Commander Card in the Discard Pile. These abilities are stronger and have effects that go beyond an specific Journey Pile. The Commander Card is trapped in the Discard Pile until the Play Deck is finished and the Discard Pile is reshufled. When that happens, the Commander Card is freed and goes back to the Commander who owned it.

- Abilities can only be used in the Commander's turn, when they are the Active Commander.
- Abilities can only be played if the Active Commander has the Commander Card in front of them. If the card is trapped in a Journey Pile or Discard Pile, the Commander has to wait until the Commander Card is freed.
- Abilities can be played several times in the same turn, as long as the trapped/freed rules are respected.

### Commander Ability Explanations

## Hyperspeed! Cards

Hyperspeed cards are wildcard cards.
They can replace any card in the ladder sequence.
Hyperspeed cards can be used as Wormhole cards to start new ladders.

## Final Frontier Cards

Once a Journey Pile reaches the Final Frontier. The pile is removed from the Play Area and placed in a Discard Pile.
If there were Commander Cards in Journey Pile, remember to return them to the Commanders who owned them.

## Running out of cards in the Play Deck

If the Play Deck runs out of cards. Take all the cards from the Discard Pile, shuffle them and place them face down as the new Play deck near the Hyperspace Area.
If there were Commander Cards in Discard Pile, remember to return them to the Commanders who owned them.

## To Victory!

You are all set! May you bring the glory and furryness of our Empire to the confines of the galaxy!
Godspeed commanders!
