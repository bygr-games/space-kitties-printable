You are all freelance commanders of the glorious Kitten Adventurers Space Agency (KASA)

You have all been tasked with a list of planets you have to explore.

To get there you need to carefully plan and excecute your travel through the galaxy.
Plan the routes, find a wormhole and start your journey!
But watch out, your hyperspace wormholes can be hijacked by other commanders, or you can hijack theirs.

Be the quickest, wittiest and furriest captain to visit all the planets. For the glory of Kattus our Benevolent Emperor!

1. **Place your Star Map:** Each player takes a _Star Map_ and places it in front on them. This will the individual player area.
   Make sure to leave enough space in the center for the _Play Area_.
2. **Define yourself:** Each player takes a _Commander Portrait_ that best fits their personality. Place it in the _Commander marker_ in each _Star Map_.
3. **Shuffle:** Shuffle all cards in a single Card deck, place it near the Play Area, face down.

   - 2-5 Players: 10 cards
   - 6 Players: 7 Cards
   - 7 Players: 6 Cards
   - 8 Players: 5 Cards

   Each player, place the Quest cards in a small pile over the Quest marker in their Star Map.

   - 2-6 Players: 7 cards
   - 7-8 Players: 6 cards
   - Any amount of players: 5 cards for a slower game

   Each player takes this cards in their hand and keeps it private.

6. **You are ready to start!** The player who wants to start first, starts. Fortune favours the bold!

## Goal of the Game

The first player to clear his Quests pile, wins the game.

## Game Structure

- Each player plays its turn one-by-one playing clockwise until the game ends. During its turn, this player is considered the Active Player.
- Players will build ladders in the Play Area.
- Ladders are always started with a Wormhole (0) and will grow in ascending order until the Final Frontier (12).
- Any player can add cards to any ladder.
- Cards are placed on a ladder by covering the previous card forming a pile.
- There can be many ladder piles in play at the same time.
- Only a card that is the next number in the sequence can be played in a pile. (The sequence is: Wormhole (0) -> Planets (1-11) -> Final Frontier (12))
- Only the Active Player can place cards.
- The Active Player can place as many cards as it wants in the Play Area.
- Played cards can be from its hand, Star Map lanes or Quest pile.
- **End of turn:** When the Active Player cannot or doesn't wish to play more cards he must end its turn by placing a card from its hand in the one of the Star Map lanes.
  Once the Active Player places a card in the Star Map the turn ends and the next player in the starts its turn.

## Turn Sequence

1. **Refill Hand:** The Active Player takes as many cards from the Card Deck as needed to go back to the defined Player Hand size (7 cards for 2-6 Players, 6 cards for 7-8 Players, 5 cards for slow games).
   For example: Petter has 3 cards, he needs to have 7. He takes 4 cards from the Card deck.
2. **Place cards in the Play Area:**
   - The Active Player can place cards from 3 different sources:
     - **The Active Player's hand**: If the Active player doesn't have cards in its hand, it must Refill from the Card deck back to the defined Player Hand size (7 cards for 2-6 Players, 6 cards for 7-8 Players, 5 cards for slow games).
     - **The Active Player's Quest pile**: Only the top card of the pile can be played. Once the top card is played, flip the next card face up. The Active Player can place more than one Quest card in the same turn.
     - **The Star Map lanes:** Only the top card of each stack can be played. If a card is under another card in a lane, the card that is covering must be removed first in order to free the card underneath. Star Map cards cannot be moved between lanes. They can only be played in the Play Area.
   - The player can place as many cards as it wants in the Play Area, as long as are valid for the ladder sequence. (Wormhole (0) -> Planets (1-11) -> Final Frontier (12))
   - The player is not forced to play cards in the Play Area, it can decide to stop this stage at any time.
   - If the player runs out of cards, it Refills its Hand from the Card Deck up to the defined Player Hand size (7 cards for 2-6 Players, 6 cards for 7-8 Players, 5 cards for slow games). After refilling it can continue placing cards in the Play Area as normal.
   - If the player doesn't have any valid cards to place in the Play Area, or doesn't want to place anymore, it proceeds to the next step.
3. **Place card in Star Map lane:**
   - The player MUST place a card from its hand in a Star Map lane.
   - The player can only place ONE card each turn.
   - Each player has 4 lanes.
   - Any card type can be placed in any lane.
   - If a lane already has cards the new card will be added on top of the stack partially covering the previous cards.
   - Once placed, cards cannot be moved or removed from the Star Map. The only way to remove them is by playing the topmost of each stack in the Play Area during your turn.

## Hyperspeed! Cards

Hyperspeed cards are wildcard cards.
They can replace any card in the ladder sequence.
Hyperspeed cards can be used as Wormhole cards to start new ladders.

## Final Frontier Cards

Once a ladder reaches the Final Frontier. The pile is removed from the Play Area and placed in a Discard Pile.

## Running out of cards

If the Card deck runs out of cards. Take all the cards from the Discard Pile, shuffle them and place them as the new Card deck, face down near the Play Area.

## To Victory!

You are all set! May you bring the glory and furryness of our Empire to the confines of the galaxy!
Godspeed commanders!
